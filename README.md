<h2>📂 Projects</h2>
<p>Below are some of the technical projects I've recently completed as part of my studies.  
I will continue updating these as I progress through the course, and beyond.</p>

<h3>1. Robot Can Picker (Bender V1_3)</h3>
<p>
  This task introduced me to the basics of robotics and simple automation. I built a small setup that could
  identify and pick up a can from a fixed position, mainly focusing on getting the movement and sensing
  logic working reliably. Most of the work involved testing, adjusting, and understanding how the
  mechanical and electronic parts behaved together. It was my first proper hands-on robotics exercise.
</p>

<h3>2. Exploring the Titanic Dataset (Seaborn & Pandas)</h3>
<p>
  This assignment was centred around exploring the Titanic dataset using Pandas and Seaborn. I cleaned and
  inspected the data, created a range of visualisations, and looked at patterns such as survival rates
  across gender, age, and passenger class. It helped me get comfortable with basic data handling and
  presenting findings clearly.
</p>

<h3>3. Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
  Here I worked with both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the Penguins and Titanic
  datasets. I prepared the data, selected features, trained a few different models, and compared their
  results. The aim was to understand how the algorithms behaved and what sort of outcomes they produced.
  It gave me a good foundation in building simple ML workflows.
</p>

<h3>4. Neural Networks & Deep Learning (PyTorch Demo)</h3>
<p>
  This assignment introduced me to neural networks using PyTorch. I built a straightforward feed-forward
  model and trained it to see how each part of the process works — from tensors and layers to loss and
  optimisation. It was a simple exercise, but it helped me get to grips with how deep learning operates at
  a basic level.
